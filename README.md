### Services matrix

Service            |            | Container Name | Ports (ext:int)
-------------------|------------|----------------|-----------------
 api               | php, app   | hcib-db        | 
 nginx             | Nginx      | hcib-nginx     | 8181:8181
 db                | Postgresql | hcib-db        | 5439:5432           
 rmq               | RabbitMQ   | hcib-rmq       | 15679:15672 

## Features

### Mandatory

- :white_check_mark: The application must use an SQL database to store users and record logs of past
requests.
- :white_check_mark: The application must be able to authenticate registered users.
- :white_check_mark: The application must have these three endpoints:
- :white_check_mark: An endpoint to create a new User, storing the email and information to log in later.
- :white_check_mark: An endpoint to request a stock quote, like this:

`GET /stock?q=IBM`

```json
{
"symbol": "IBM",
"open": 123.66,
"high": 123.66,
"low": 122.49,
"close": 123
}
```

- :white_check_mark: The same endpoint must additionally send an email with the same information to the user who
requested the quote.
- :white_check_mark: An endpoint to retrieve the history of queries made to the API service by that user. The endpoint
should return the list of entries saved in the database, showing the latest entries first:
`GET /history`

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2021-04-01T19:20:30Z",
    "symbol": "IBM",
    "open": "123.66",
    "high": 123.66,
    "low": 122.49,
    "close": "123"
  },
  {
    "date": "2021-03-25T11:10:55Z",
    "symbol": "IBM",
    "open": "121.10",
    "high": 123.66,
    "low": 122,
    "close": "122"
  }
]
```

### Bonus

The following features are optional to implement, but if you do, you'll be ranked higher in our
evaluation process.

- :white_check_mark: Add unit tests, and integration tests for the endpoints.
- :white_check_mark: Use RabbitMQ to send the email asynchronously.
- :white_check_mark: Use JWT instead of basic authentication for endpoints.
- :white_check_mark: Containerize the app.
- :white_check_mark: Postman Collection.
- :eight_pointed_black_star: Creation of a simple frontend using Vue to interact with the API.


## Postman
There is also available , in the doc folder , a postman collection to be imported on postman:

- `<project_root>/doc/api/LWS.postman_collection.json`


## Tests

### Setup 

```sh
php bin/console --env=test doctrine:database:create
php bin/console --env=test doctrine:schema:create
php bin/console --env=test doctrine:fixtures:load
```
